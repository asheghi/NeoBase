## How it works

NeoBase is a combination of open source tools. Weâ€™re building the features of Firebase using enterprise-grade, open source products. If the tools and communities exist, with an MIT, Apache 2, or equivalent open license, we will use and support that tool. If the tool doesn't exist, we build and open source it ourselves. NeoBase is not a 1-to-1 mapping of Firebase. Our aim is to give developers a Firebase-like developer experience using open source tools.

**Technology Stack**

NeoBase is a [hosted platform](https://neobase.ir). You can sign up and start using NeoBase without installing anything.
You can also [self-host](https://neobase.ir/docs/) and [develop locally](https://neobase.ir/docs/).

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/) MongoDB is a document database designed for ease of application development and scaling
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html) Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of the box.
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) a UI library, with An approachable, performant and versatile approach for building web user interfaces
